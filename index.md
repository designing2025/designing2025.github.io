# 2nd International Workshop on Designing Software
### April ??, 2025
### Co-located with [ICSE 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025), Ottawa, Canada

Software design is a set of activities and decisions that are involved in the construction of a software system, ranging from high-level architecture and conceptual design to code design. Decisions made during a design process have long-lasting impact on various qualities of a system, such as modularity, maintainability, scalability, robustness, security, usability, and performance. Despite its important role in software development, design is a subject that is still relatively little understood by both researchers and engineers – particularly in terms of design as an activity rather than design as a product/outcome. Although exceptions exist, in practice, design is frequently carried out in a somewhat ad-hoc, implicit manner. Teams often succeed in some way, though not always. Collectively, the research community has to date little systematic understanding of what makes certain designs and design processes successful, how to package and transfer knowledge about design and designing between teams and organizations, and how to design systems that are robust against a continuously evolving context. Teaching software design also remains a challenge for educators, with design being considered a skill that is acquired mainly through experience rather than something that can be taught in classrooms. 

This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and educators who are interested in any aspect of software design, though we hope to place a specific focus on **designing software as an activity** in which developers, teams, and organizations engage. The workshop seeks to identify new directions and open challenges for the field. The workshop will be highly interactive and discussion-based, centered around a core set of topics on software design research and education. Each session will begin with short presentations by participants on a topic and proceed with breakout sessions to discuss the topic in depth. The outcome of the workshop is expected to be a report summarizing open problems, promising approaches, and next steps for advancing the state-of-the-art in software design practices and education.

## Call for Contributions

We invite submissions of: (1) position papers on visions or new directions for software design (max. 4 pages), (2) research papers presenting novel contributions on software design (max. 6 pages), (3) experience reports describing lessons learned in a practical or educational setting (max. 6 pages), and (4) proposals for presentations (max. 2 pages). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Empirical studies on software design
- Cognitive and social aspects of software design
- Designing software in hybrid and remote settings
- The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on software design; the role of design in AI-assisted software development
- Processes and evaluation standards for software design research
- Software design methodologies, principles, strategies, and patterns
- Case studies of design successes and failures
- Approaches for software design education, including pedagogies, curriculum development, and case studies
- AI-assisted software design education
- Theory building for/of software design
- Software design for social dimensions (e.g., ethics, sustainability, privacy)
- Software design for emerging domains (e.g., cyber-physical systems, IoT)
- Rigorous approaches to software design (e.g., modeling and validation)
